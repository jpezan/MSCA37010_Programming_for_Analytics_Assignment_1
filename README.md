### How often are Toyotas towed in Chicago?

Your task is to read a csv file containing Chicago "Towed Vehicles" data and extract the information requested below. This file contains the last 90 days of data on vehicles which have been towed. Each line represents a towed car.

The file is vailable at https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Towed-Vehicles/ygr5-vcbg
Please make sure you download a "csv" and not a "csv for excel" file.

1. Go through the file and find the number of vehicles towed
2. Go through the file and find the number of Toyotas (TOYT) towed in the file
3. What percentage of towed vehicles were Toyota?

### Logistics
You may only use "core" Python (not Pandas or any library not bundled with Python).

Please create a Jupyter lab (or Jupyter notebook) which contains code to process a file which has already been downloaded. I will download the file myself, you don't have to provide it. You only need to upload your notebook file to canvas.

The notebook should be properly documented, as if you were going to share this with an engineering team, which will deploy this code in production. In other words, use proper headings, write out the answers in English, etc.

The file should not contain any errors - execute the file with "Restart kernel and run all." Assume the file is in the same location as the notebook and that the file will be called "Towed_Vehicles.csv"

### Grading
You are expected to write this code. You may consult any website, although the most useful reference will be the "First Programs" lecture notes we discussed in class (available at lectures/015_first_programs/first_programs.ipynb).

If you are not able to figure out the code, you may ask a classmate for help. However, you MUST add a note which gives the names of everyone who helped you with the answer. If you help another student, you MUST provide their name in your own assignment.

If you find an example on the web (for example, on Stack Overflow), you MUST provide a link to that code snippet.

### FAQ
1. How do I upload the assignment?
You upload the assignment via canvas. You only need to upload the notebook containing your code. I'll download the file myself.
